* React

* fetch API
* Testing with Enzyme & Jest

# Learning Goals

The main goal of building Shakebeer was to get familiar with React and how to test React with Enzyme and Jest. We learned how React components interact with one another, how to test those components, and how to use Sass to write more efficient CSS. The app was built from scratch and utilizes array-prototype methods to extract and manipulate data. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
